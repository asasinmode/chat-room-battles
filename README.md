This is the repository for **Chat Room Battles**, a text-based auto-battler where you construct messages with emojis then send them to battle against other players.

# Contributing

At the moment this is a public source project. I'm not looking for contributors but if you find any issues or have an idea you'd want to implement, get in touch and we can discuss it. Pull requests are not guaranteed to be merged, so please ask first before doing any work.
